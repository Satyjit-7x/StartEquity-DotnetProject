StartEquity
Democratizing Startup Investing. Powering the next generation of innovators.

StartEquity is a .NET Core application designed to bridge the gap between innovative startups seeking capital and everyday investors. Our platform empowers emerging companies to raise funds by diluting equity through various funding rounds, while simultaneously allowing individuals to invest in private ventures with minimal capital.

A key feature of StartEquity is its secondary marketplace, which provides liquidity by enabling investors to sell their shares to other users on the platform.

The Problem We Solve
Traditionally, investing in high-growth startups has been inaccessible to the average person due to high capital requirements and a lack of connections. On the other side, startups often struggle to reach a broad base of potential investors. StartEquity breaks down these barriers, creating a transparent and accessible ecosystem for both founders and investors.

Key Features
Our platform is built with distinct features catering to the needs of both companies and investors.
