StartEquity is a .NET Core application designed to bridge the gap between innovative startups seeking capital and everyday investors. Our platform empowers emerging companies to raise funds by diluting equity through various funding rounds, while simultaneously allowing individuals to invest in private ventures with minimal capital.

A key feature of StartEquity is its secondary marketplace, which provides liquidity by enabling investors to sell their shares to other users on the platform.

The Problem We Solve
Traditionally, investing in high-growth startups has been inaccessible to the average person due to high capital requirements and a lack of connections. On the other side, startups often struggle to reach a broad base of potential investors. StartEquity breaks down these barriers, creating a transparent and accessible ecosystem for both founders and investors.

Key Features
Our platform is built with distinct features catering to the needs of both companies and investors.

Capital Fundraising: Create detailed company profiles and launch structured funding rounds (e.g., Seed, Series A, Series B).

Equity Management: Seamlessly offer, issue, and manage company shares to investors.

Investor Relations Dashboard: Track your funding progress and manage all your investors in one central place.

For Investors 💸

Accessible Investing: Discover and invest in a curated list of promising startups with a small amount of capital.

Portfolio Management: Track the performance of your investments and manage your holdings through a personal dashboard.

Secondary Marketplace: A unique platform to buy or sell equity from other investors, providing an exit strategy before an IPO or acquisition.
